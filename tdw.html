            Toronto Data Workshop brings together academia and industry to share data science and AI best practice. We are broadly interested, but especially in the code- and data-centric aspects of a project that are often glossed over. We meet weekly for an hour and most talks are recorded. If you would like to attend, please sign up <a href="https://rohanalexander.substack.com">here</a>. Everyone is welcome---it is free and you do not need to be affiliated with the university.

                <li>Japan is a democracy, yet electoral competition is utterly dominated by a single party. For sixty-six of the past seventy years, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled Japan's government. I draw on thirty-five years' worth of new fiscal, demographic, and voting behavior – carefully matched to thousands of Japanese municipalities – to empirically test how has this situation come about, and how is it sustained?</li>

She is an editor at the <i>Journal of Politics</i> and serves as Director of Undergraduate Studies. She has written about the effects of electoral systems on politicians' policy priorities, ideological positions, and allocations of government resources. Recently, she has been interested in distributive politics. Her research is inspired by substantively-important questions in Japanese politics, and she has created data sets for her own research that are available for use by others. She uses text-as-data, quasi-experiments, and qualitative analysis. She received her Ph.D. from the Department of Government at Harvard University, where she is also a Faculty Associate at the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations. She is a co-founder and organizer of the Japanese Politics Online Seminar Series (JPOSS). She also organizes and hosts Frontiers in Empirical Research on East Asia conference at NYU (FEREA).

                <li>Cause-of-death data from vital statistics underpin public health surveillance, yet few tools exist to quantify mortality data quality in high-income countries at a subnational level. We develop metrics to measure three dimensions of mortality data quality and apply them to U.S. county mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause-of-Death files, 1999–2022. All three dimensions exhibit substantial and persistent geographic inequalities, with lower-income counties and those using coroner-based medicolegal systems showing poorer data quality. Our framework enables scalable monitoring of subnational reporting quality over time and supports targeted investments to strengthen death certification and public health surveillance.</li>

                <li>
                  I will discuss leveraging causal discovery in product analytics to uncover new insights and improve product development. First, I introduce a framework for categorizing causal questions, highlighting common challenges in product analytics, and emphasizing the need for discovering new causes that drive outcomes. I will present a process for generating hypotheses about causal relationships that are likely to lead to successful ideas for product improvements that can be validated through experiments. The key methodological insight is to model event data before they are aggregated, which helps us isolate causal relationships between events and allows for bias reduction to be automated under certain assumptions.

                <li>
                  The American non-profit sector faces significant challenges in fully understanding the complex landscape in which it operates, particularly when it comes to accessing reliable data on individual giving in the U.S. At the same time, there is increasing interest in gaining a more comprehensive view of the generosity ecosystem—one that encompasses not only monetary donations to formal non-profits but also volunteerism, in-kind contributions, advocacy, and peer-to-peer giving. To this end, this presentation will explore the objectives of the GivingTuesday Data Commons, its core features, and potential use cases. Additionally, it will introduce the GivingPulse project, an ongoing weekly survey that tracks a broad spectrum of individual giving behaviours and related attitudes.

                <li>
                  Alignment has become a buzzword that frequently surfaces throughout the AI ecosystem. But what does it mean to align LLMs to the hundreds of millions of people who now interact with their outputs, each with different preferences for language, conversational norms, value systems, and political beliefs? This talk will explore the gnarly concept of alignment, specifically for large language models (LLMs). Using insights from the recently released <a href="https://hannahkirk.github.io/prism-alignment/">PRISM Alignment Dataset</a>, we'll cover key questions around empirical alignment efforts, such as how to collect human feedback using various scales and signals, where to focus human labour, who to ask for feedback, and whether to target objectives of personalised or collective alignment. Through more comprehensive and representative data, PRISM highlights the challenges of aligning LLMs to meet the diverse expectations and beliefs of a global audience.

                <li>
                  Advances in LLMs have raised concerns over scalable, personalized political persuasion. In this talk, based on a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403116121">paper recently published in PNAS</a>, we integrate user data into GPT-4 prompts in real-time, facilitating the live creation of messages tailored to persuade individual users on political issues. We then deploy this application at scale to test whether personalized, microtargeted messaging offers a persuasive advantage compared to nontargeted messaging. We find that while messages generated by GPT-4 were persuasive, in aggregate, the persuasive impact of microtargeted messages was not statistically different from that of nontargeted messages. These findings suggest—contrary to widespread speculation—that the influence of current LLMs may reside not in their ability to tailor messages to individuals but rather in the persuasiveness of their generic, nontargeted messages.

                <li>
                  How can generative artificial intelligence (GAI) be used for sociological research? This talk explores applications to the study of text and images across multiple domains, including
                  computational, qualitative, and experimental research. Drawing upon recent research and stylized experiments with DALL-E and GPT-4, discuss the potential applications of text-to-text,
                  image-to-text, and text-to-image models for sociological research. Across these areas, GAI can make advanced computational methods more efficient, flexible, and accessible. The paper
                  also emphasizes several challenges raised by these technologies, including interpretability, transparency, reliability, reproducibility, ethics, and privacy, as well as the implications
                  of bias and bias mitigation efforts and the trade-offs between proprietary models and open-source alternatives. When used with care, these technologies can help advance many different
                  areas of sociological methodology, complementing and enhancing our existing toolkits. See: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9nft">here</a>.

                <li>
                  We compare the accuracy of six LLMs using a few-shot approach, three supervised learning algorithms (SVM, DistilRoBERTa, and a neural network trained on BERT embeddings), and a second
                  human coder on the task of categorizing "most important issue" responses from the British Election Study Internet Panel into 50 categories. For the scenario where a researcher lacks
                  existing training data, the accuracy of the highest-performing LLM (Claude-1.3: 93.9%) neared human performance (94.7%) and exceeded the highest-performing supervised approach trained on
                  1000 randomly sampled cases (neural network: 93.5%). In a scenario where previous data has been labeled but a researcher wants to label novel text, the best LLM's (Claude-1.3: 80.9%)
                  few-shot performance is only slightly behind the human (88.6%) and exceeds the best supervised model trained on 576,000 cases (DistilRoBERTa: 77.8%). PaLM-2, Llama-2, and the SVM all
                  performed substantially worse than the best LLMs and supervised models across all metrics and scenarios. Our results suggest that LLMs may allow for greater use of open-ended survey
                  questions in the future. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20531680241231468">Open access paper</a> published in <i>Research & Politics</i> by Jonathan Mellon, Jack

                  Code reviews are a critical part of the software development process, taking a significant amount of the code authors' and the code reviewers' time. As part of this process, the reviewer
                  inspects the proposed code and asks the author for code changes through comments written in natural language. With machine learning, we have an opportunity to automate and streamline the
                  code-review process, e.g., by proposing code changes based on a comment's text.

                <li>
                  In the past decade, governments, non-profits, and other civic institutions have increasingly been sharing data on a wide range of topics, supporting various sectors of society from
                  private enterprise to academic research. However, using this data in a programmatic and reproducible fashion is hampered by the myriad nature of the APIs provided to access it. In this
                  talk, we explore one potential alternative to the predominant REST paradigm: storing tabular data in the open Parquet file format on publicly accessible endpoints. By using this
                  standardized file format and a simple backing infrastructure, new tools based on Apache Arrow, such as DuckDB and Polars, can be used to build reusable front ends and other
                  cost-effective solutions. We present a case study based on Statistics Canada's library of public data sets, showcasing how such a system can simplify initial selection and filtering
                  through common SQL queries.

                  cancer genomics. Recently, he has led efforts to develop statistical machine learning methodology to integrate single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing data to uncover the effects of tumour
                  clonal identity on gene expression, as well as methods to automatically delineate the tumour microenvironment from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Such findings can improve our
                  understanding of cancer progression and of why certain tumours are resistant to therapies, leading to relapse.

              <h3>Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility</h3>

              <p>
                An annual workshop focused on reproducibility in data science and statistics. Free and hosted via Zoom. Jointly hosted by CANSSI Ontario and the Data Sciences Institute. Supported by the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences.
              </p>

              <p>
                This conference brings together academic and industry participants on the critical issue of reproducibility in applied statistics and related areas. The conference is free and hosted online. Everyone is welcome, you don't need to be affiliated with a university.
              </p>

              <p>The conference has three broad areas of focus:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaluating reproducibility:</strong> Systematically looking at the extent of reproducibility of a paper or even in a whole field is important to understand where weaknesses exist. Does, say, economics fall flat while demography shines? How should we approach these reproductions? What aspects contribute to the extent of reproducibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Practices of reproducibility:</strong> We need new tools and approaches that encourage us to think more deeply about reproducibility and integrate it into everyday practice.</li>
                <li><strong>Teaching reproducibility:</strong> While it is probably too late for most of us, how can we ensure that today's students don't repeat our mistakes? What are some case studies that show promise? How can we ensure this doesn't happen again?</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <h3>2023</h3>

            <h3>Wednesday, 22 February</h3>
            <p>
              Toronto Replication Games. Participants will be matched with other researchers working in the same field (e.g., economics, American Politics). Each team will work on replicating a recently published study in a leading econ/poli sci journal.

                    In reproducibility, we often focus on 1) reproducible research practices and 2) teaching these practices to students. In this talk, I will talk about a third dimension of reproducibility: reproducible teaching. Instructors use tools and adopt practices in preparing their teaching materials. I will discuss how reproducibility relates to these tools and practices. I will share examples from my statistics and data science courses and make recommendations based on teaching experiences.

                    R users have long enjoyed the ability to render professional looking documents using R Markdown. Output formats include reports, blog posts, presentation slides, books, and more. These documents can contain a mixture of narrative, code, and code output, so they are ideally suited to reproducible work. Results and figures can be generated upon rendering, greatly minimizing the risk of copy/paste errors and outdated results. The benefits of R Markdown are now available to users of Python and Julia, in the form of Quarto, an R Markdown successor. Since Fall 2022, I have required my Data Science students to create their project reports using Python + Quarto. In this talk, I'll introduce Quarto and some of its features, and report on my students' experience learning and using it.

                  <li>
                    In my presentation, I will summarize the process of replicating a surprising finding of researchers who reported about a statistically significant increase of suicide rates during full moon in northern Finland, but only among younger women, and only in winter. We failed to replicate this finding with much larger samples based on the Austrian and Swedish suicide register. The finding from Finland was likely false positive. I will discuss problematic research and publication practices related to these findings.

                    Research code is difficult to understand and build upon because it isn't standardized; research pipelines are artisan. TrovBase is a data management platform that standardizes the process from dataset configuration to analysis, and does so in a way that makes sharing analysis (and building upon it) easy and fast. The TrovBase team will discuss how to make graphs and analysis maximally reproducible using TrovBase.

                  <li>
                    The open and transparent documentation of scientific processes has been established as a core antecedent of free knowledge. This also holds for generating robust insights in the scope of research projects. To convince academic peers and the public, the research process must be understandable and retraceable (reproducible), and repeatable (replicable) by others, precluding the inclusion of fluke findings into the canon of insights. In this contribution, we outline what reproducibility and replicability (R&R) could mean in the scope of different disciplines and traditions of research and which significance R&R has for generating insights in these fields. We draw on projects conducted in the scope of the Wikimedia "Open Science Fellows Program" (Fellowship Freies Wissen), an interdisciplinary, long-running funding scheme for projects contributing to open research practices. We identify twelve implemented projects from different disciplines which primarily focused on R&R, and multiple additional projects also touching on R&R. From these projects, we identify patterns and synthesize them into a roadmap of how research projects can achieve R&R across different disciplines. We further outline the ground covered by these projects and propose ways forward.

                  <li>
                    One of the goals of reproducibility - the basis for all subsequent inquiries - is to assure users of a research compendium that it is complete. How do we do that? We re-run code. But what if the data underlying the compendium is confidential (sensitive)? What if it is transient (Twitter)? What if it is so big that it takes weeks to run? All of the above? I will talk about efforts in designing a way to credibly convey that the compendium has run at least once, and the many questions that might arise around that.

                    Reproducibility is challenging for everyone, but for biological researchers that have not been trained in good computing practices, maintaining a reproducible practice might appear impossible on first glance. We will go over specific strategies for researchers that do not come from computational backgrounds.

                    I will present a study that looked at the Open Data badge policy at the journal Psychological Science. We attempted to reproduce 14 articles (at least 3 independent reproduction attempts each) that received the Open Data badge, and found that only 1 was exactly reproducible and 3 further articles were essentially reproducible. I will discuss our results and recommendations for the implementation of Open Data badges as incentives for increasing reproducibility and transparency.

                  <li>
                    Electronic health records (EHRs) are becoming a central source of data for biomedical research and have potential to improve our understanding of healthcare delivery and disease processes. However, the analysis of EHR data remains both practically and methodologically challenging as it is recorded as a byproduct of clinical care and not generated for research purposes. In this talk, we will describe the reproducibility challenge in EHR-based research and introduce our ongoing work developing a pipeline for real-world evidence with EHRs.

                  <li>
                    Reproducibility is fundamental to the open science movement to ensure science is transparent and accessible, but much of the work on reproducibility has come from quantitative research and data. However, the principles of transparency are equally relevant to qualitative researchers despite some unique challenges implementing transparent practices, given the nature of qualitative data. In this presentation, we will introduce the principles and concepts that underpin qualitative transparency and describe how we at the Guttmacher Institute have been developing and implementing qualitative transparency practices in our work. Guttmacher conducts policy-relevant research on sexual and reproductive health, and our qualitative data often includes sensitive content, underlining the ethical imperative to protect participant confidentiality. We will describe how we have embedded transparency into our qualitative projects through the use of transparency launch meetings and checklists, among other practices, and we will highlight previous and current projects at Guttmacher that are making some aspects of their projects publicly available.

                  <li>
                    With recent advances in molecular profiling and computational technologies, there has been growing interest in developing and using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in personalized medicine and precision oncology. An active area of research in this domain is focused on the development of computational models capable of predicting therapy response for cancer patients. In a recent publication in Nature Cancer, Ma et al. presented a novel approach, named "Transfer of Cell Line Response Prediction" (TCRP), which utilizes few-shot learning to transfer drug response prediction from immortalized cancer cell line data to more complex in vitro patient-derived cell cultures and in vivo patient-derived xenografts. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method in enabling the development of computational models that can accurately predict drug response in various contexts. Given the impressive results, we aim to address two main issues: (1) validating the performance of the TCRP model in its published context (reproducibility) and (2) extending its applicability to a broader range of preclinical pharmacogenomic and clinical trial data (reusability). The deployment of models such as TCRP will significantly contribute to improving personalized medicine by facilitating the selection of optimal therapy for individual patients based on their molecular profile.

                    While approaches to reproducibility in code are well-established, there is less focus on reproducibility in the context of datasets. In this talk, I will introduce an approach to enhancing the reproducibility of dataset construction through automated data testing. My joint work with Dr. Rohan Alexander on digitizing the Australian Hansard will be discussed as a case study, with specific examples of data validation and reproducible practices from our work.

                  <li>
                    Journals claim that one of the reasons authors are required to make data available is to facilitate reproducibility in research. However, most of the time, when data are publicly available, they are not in the right format to perform the analysis. In this talk, I share the challenges I have experienced in trying to reproduce the results of some published papers using data sources presented in their data availability statements. I also suggest some ways to improve the reproducibility pipeline, especially when the analytical data set is created from multiple data sources.

                    If our results are to have any useful impact in the world, they not only have to be (broadly) correct they also have to be interpreted correctly, and it's our responsibility, as data scientists, to maximize the chances that this will be the case. What can we do to increase the likelihood of correct interpretations, and can software help?

                    I am part of an infectious diseases modelling group that has informed Australia's national pandemic preparedness and response plans for the past ~15 years. In collaboration with public health colleagues since 2015, we have developed and deployed near-real-time seasonal influenza forecasts. We rapidly adapted these methods to COVID-19 and, since April 2020, near-real-time COVID-19 forecasts have informed public health responses in Australian states and territories. Ensuring that our results are valid and reproducible is a key aspect of our research. We are also part of a broader consortium whose remit includes building sustainable quantitative research capacity in the Asia-Pacific region. In this talk I will discuss how we are trying to embed reproducible research practices into our EMCR cohort, beginning with version control workflows and normalising peer code review as an integral part of academic research.

                  <li>
                    Erroneous conversions of gene names into other types of data, such as dates and numbers, have been a long-standing issue in computational biology. This issue can have a significant impact on data reproducibility and the advancement of science and technology in the field. While this problem was first identified in 2004 and has been studied extensively in 2016 and 2021, it continues to occur. Through observation, it has been found that gene names can not only be converted to dates and floating numbers, but also to an internal date format of five-digit numbers. This highlights the limitations of using spreadsheets to manage and analyze large genomics data. Spreadsheets can misinterpret gene names as other types of data, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data. This can make it challenging to reproduce results and hinder progress in the field. To improve data reproducibility and support the development of science and technology, it may be necessary to consider alternative methods for managing and analyzing large genomics data. In summary, it is crucial to use the appropriate software tools to handle large genomics data to avoid inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data that can impede the progress of science and technology.
