          Toronto Data Workshop brings together academia and industry to share data science and AI best practice. We are broadly interested, but especially in the code- and data-centric aspects of a project that are often glossed over. We meet weekly for an hour and most talks are recorded. If you would like to attend, please sign up <a href="https://rohanalexander.substack.com">here</a>. Everyone is welcome---it is free and you do not need to be affiliated with the university.

            <li>
              I will discuss leveraging causal discovery in product analytics to uncover new insights and improve product development. First, I introduce a framework for categorizing causal questions, highlighting common challenges in product analytics, and emphasizing the need for discovering new causes that drive outcomes. I will present a process for generating hypotheses about causal relationships that are likely to lead to successful ideas for product improvements that can be validated through experiments. The key methodological insight is to model event data before they are aggregated, which helps us isolate causal relationships between events and allows for bias reduction to be automated under certain assumptions.

            <li>
              The American non-profit sector faces significant challenges in fully understanding the complex landscape in which it operates, particularly when it comes to accessing reliable data on individual giving in the U.S. At the same time, there is increasing interest in gaining a more comprehensive view of the generosity ecosystem—one that encompasses not only monetary donations to formal non-profits but also volunteerism, in-kind contributions, advocacy, and peer-to-peer giving. To this end, this presentation will explore the objectives of the GivingTuesday Data Commons, its core features, and potential use cases. Additionally, it will introduce the GivingPulse project, an ongoing weekly survey that tracks a broad spectrum of individual giving behaviours and related attitudes.

            <li>
              Alignment has become a buzzword that frequently surfaces throughout the AI ecosystem. But what does it mean to align LLMs to the hundreds of millions of people who now interact with their outputs, each with different preferences for language, conversational norms, value systems, and political beliefs? This talk will explore the gnarly concept of alignment, specifically for large language models (LLMs). Using insights from the recently released <a href="https://hannahkirk.github.io/prism-alignment/">PRISM Alignment Dataset</a>, we'll cover key questions around empirical alignment efforts, such as how to collect human feedback using various scales and signals, where to focus human labour, who to ask for feedback, and whether to target objectives of personalised or collective alignment. Through more comprehensive and representative data, PRISM highlights the challenges of aligning LLMs to meet the diverse expectations and beliefs of a global audience.

            <li>
              Advances in LLMs have raised concerns over scalable, personalized political persuasion. In this talk, based on a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403116121">paper recently published in PNAS</a>, we integrate user data into GPT-4 prompts in real-time, facilitating the live creation of messages tailored to persuade individual users on political issues. We then deploy this application at scale to test whether personalized, microtargeted messaging offers a persuasive advantage compared to nontargeted messaging. We find that while messages generated by GPT-4 were persuasive, in aggregate, the persuasive impact of microtargeted messages was not statistically different from that of nontargeted messages. These findings suggest—contrary to widespread speculation—that the influence of current LLMs may reside not in their ability to tailor messages to individuals but rather in the persuasiveness of their generic, nontargeted messages.

            <li>
              How can generative artificial intelligence (GAI) be used for sociological research? This talk explores applications to the study of text and images across multiple domains, including
              computational, qualitative, and experimental research. Drawing upon recent research and stylized experiments with DALL-E and GPT-4, discuss the potential applications of text-to-text,
              image-to-text, and text-to-image models for sociological research. Across these areas, GAI can make advanced computational methods more efficient, flexible, and accessible. The paper
              also emphasizes several challenges raised by these technologies, including interpretability, transparency, reliability, reproducibility, ethics, and privacy, as well as the implications
              of bias and bias mitigation efforts and the trade-offs between proprietary models and open-source alternatives. When used with care, these technologies can help advance many different
              areas of sociological methodology, complementing and enhancing our existing toolkits. See: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9nft">here</a>.

            <li>
              We compare the accuracy of six LLMs using a few-shot approach, three supervised learning algorithms (SVM, DistilRoBERTa, and a neural network trained on BERT embeddings), and a second
              human coder on the task of categorizing "most important issue" responses from the British Election Study Internet Panel into 50 categories. For the scenario where a researcher lacks
              existing training data, the accuracy of the highest-performing LLM (Claude-1.3: 93.9%) neared human performance (94.7%) and exceeded the highest-performing supervised approach trained on
              1000 randomly sampled cases (neural network: 93.5%). In a scenario where previous data has been labeled but a researcher wants to label novel text, the best LLM's (Claude-1.3: 80.9%)
              few-shot performance is only slightly behind the human (88.6%) and exceeds the best supervised model trained on 576,000 cases (DistilRoBERTa: 77.8%). PaLM-2, Llama-2, and the SVM all
              performed substantially worse than the best LLMs and supervised models across all metrics and scenarios. Our results suggest that LLMs may allow for greater use of open-ended survey
              questions in the future. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20531680241231468">Open access paper</a> published in <i>Research & Politics</i> by Jonathan Mellon, Jack

              Code reviews are a critical part of the software development process, taking a significant amount of the code authors' and the code reviewers' time. As part of this process, the reviewer
              inspects the proposed code and asks the author for code changes through comments written in natural language. With machine learning, we have an opportunity to automate and streamline the
              code-review process, e.g., by proposing code changes based on a comment's text.

            <li>
              In the past decade, governments, non-profits, and other civic institutions have increasingly been sharing data on a wide range of topics, supporting various sectors of society from
              private enterprise to academic research. However, using this data in a programmatic and reproducible fashion is hampered by the myriad nature of the APIs provided to access it. In this
              talk, we explore one potential alternative to the predominant REST paradigm: storing tabular data in the open Parquet file format on publicly accessible endpoints. By using this
              standardized file format and a simple backing infrastructure, new tools based on Apache Arrow, such as DuckDB and Polars, can be used to build reusable front ends and other
              cost-effective solutions. We present a case study based on Statistics Canada's library of public data sets, showcasing how such a system can simplify initial selection and filtering
              through common SQL queries.

              Originally from Melbourne, Australia, Brittany received her B.A. in International Studies from the University of Saskatchewan and started her career in economic development, equipping
              her with comprehensive knowledge of foreign direct investment and international business early in her career.She went on to obtain an M.A. in European and Russian Affairs from the
              University of Toronto in 2018, where she first discovered the potential of programming for political science and became fascinated with artificial intelligence (AI). Over the past three
              years, Brittany has worked in many facets of the AI industry, from leading research and development of new AI products for video game developers to building automated data pipelines for
              business intelligence and managing software engineering and client engagement teams. In that time, she has honed technical skills in full-stack development, machine learning, and data
              engineering. She recently struck out on her own to launch an online global event monitoring tool and deliver novel solutions to clients in the political risk and social enterprise
              sectors. Brittany is a firm believer in the potential for data-driven technologies for geopolitics and is excited to contribute to the many discoveries to be made in this space.

              Shiro<a href="https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/"></a> is a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Government, Harvard University. His research focuses on democratic representation in American Politics, for instance cast vote records, public opinion, survey methods, and applied statistics more generally. Shiro will bring together best practices for organizing data and code in the social sciences that experts have proposed with some of his own experience. He will propose a project-oriented workflow that adopts a minimal and consistent file organization structure within a single project, using RStudio Projects and GitHub. He will then discuss how to organize multiple projects that share common components, and propose the use of custom R packages to share code and Dataverse to share large datasets. He will use some of his own projects involving the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), one of the largest political surveys of American Politics, as a demonstration.
