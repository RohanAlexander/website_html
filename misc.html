        <h2>Various things to do in</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Brisbane, Australia
            <ul>
              <li>Free BBQs at Kangaroo Point cliffs. Buy things to cook for an early dinner and watch the night close in.</li>
              <li>The Barra Boys, 1007 Stanley St. Great fish and chips.</li>
              <li>Pizza Caffe at the University of Queensland. Great pizza and you can walk around the uni - don't miss the Ig Nobel winning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment">pitch experiment</a>.</li>
              <li>Go for a run along the river. Start at about the Southbank Ferry Terminal, then cross the Goodwill Bridge, then either turn left for a shorter run (cross back on Kurilpa Bridge which will be about 5 km) or turn right and stick along the river and keep going until you get too tired---making it to Sydney Street Ferry Terminal is great, but even better to try to get to New Farm Park Ferry Terminal---then get a City Cat back to Southbank. That will end up about 10-15km depending on specifics.</li>
              <li>Go to the Sunshine Coast. Hire a car the day before, then starting early in the day, drive an hour north to Moffat Beach (not patrolled) then Dicky Beach (patrolled), and finally Kings Beach (patrolled). (Train + bus works also.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Canberra, Australia
            <ul>
              <li>The Cupping Room, 1 University Ave. Great coffee.</li>
              <li>Rizla, 24 Lonsdale St. Great food and Riesling.</li>
              <li>Volstead Repeal, 32 Mort St. Great drinks.</li>
              <li>ONA Coffee House, 68 Wollongong St. This is in Fyshwick, but it's worth the trip. There are second hand book shops across the road that are worth going to also.</li>
              <li>Cosmorex, 47 Kembla St, Fyshwick. Again, in Fyshwick, but worth the trip.</li>
              <li>A run from Civic down to the lake, and ideally making it across both bridges is pretty great. Will end up at about 8-10km depending on where you're leaving from in Civic.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Melbourne, Australia
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://patriciacoffee.com.au">Patricia Coffee Brewers</a>, Rear of 493-495 Little Bourke St. Incredible coffee.</li>
              <li>Flora Indian Restaurant, 238 Flinders St. Cheap but great Indian food.</li>
              <li>Brunetti, 250 Flinders Ln. Over the top cakes and pastries.</li>
              <li>You can book a meeting room at the State library if you're a member (free to join).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sydney, Australia
            <ul>
              <li>Campos Coffee, 193 Missenden Road, Newtown. Great coffee. Get an affogato. And a flat white. And a long black.</li>
              <li>Go to Manly. Take a ferry from Circular Quay to Manly Ferry---get the commuter one, not the "fast" one. At Manly you can go to the beach, get coffee, and the walk to Shelly Beach is nice.</li>
              <li>"Central" station isn't actually that central---you'll likely want Wynyard.</li>
              <li>Ampersand, 78 Oxford St, Paddington. Get a cup of coffee and sit amongst the books.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>San Francisco, California
            <ul>
              <li>Twin Peaks. Brilliant views of the city. Pick a clear time of day (early afternoon is safest if you're not flexible). You could walk up, but it's a bit of effort.</li>
              <li>Baker Beach. Great beach for views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Can be a bit breezy.</li>
              <li>Ike's Place, 3489 16th St. Brilliant sandwiches. Go early or late or call to avoid large lines. Get the Dutch Crunch bread.</li>
              <li>Bi-Rite Creamery, 3692 18th Street. Nice ice cream. Don't miss the lavender one.</li>
              <li>Tartine Bakery, 600 Guerrero Street. Very nice cakes. Avoid peak times otherwise there's big lines and it's hard to get a table.</li>
              <li>Sightglass, 270 7th Street. Nice coffee. Nice place to sit down and see the SF people. No Wi-Fi.</li>
              <li>La Taqueria, 2889 Mission Street. Carnitas burrito is better than beef burrito. Get sour cream but not super. Carnitas taco is better than chicken taco but both are great.</li>
              <li>Taquerias El Farolito, 2779 Mission Street. Enormous burritos and delicious tacos. Everything is great.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Berkeley, California
            <ul>
              <li>Bobby G's Pizzeria, 2072 University Ave. Great pizza. Sometimes has Pliny on tap!</li>
              <li>Cheese Board Collective Pizzeria, 1512 Shattuck Ave. One type of pizza each day. Always vegetarian. Always great.</li>
              <li>Hotsy Totsy, 601 San Pablo Ave. Great dive bar.</li>
              <li>Tacos El Autlense, taco truck that parks in the Hotsy Totsy car park. Brilliant food. And you can take the food into the bar.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Toronto, Canada
            <ul>
              <li>California Sandwiches, 244 Claremont St. Great but cheap sandwiches.</li>
              <li>Good Egg, 156 Augusta Ave. A book shop in Kensington Market that is focused on kitchen books. It sounds niche, and it is, but it's also great. [HT: Ryan Briggs].</li>
              <li>Vietnam Lovely Noodle, 378 Bloor St W. Great but cheap noodles.</li>
              <li>Evangeline Toronto, 51 Camden St. This is a bar on Level 14 of the Ace Hotel. Go early on a nice evening and try for the outside table around the corner for a great view.</li>
              <li>Tap Phong, 360 Spadina Ave. This shop in Chinatown provides an incredible selection of kitchen supplies at decent prices. Again, sounds weird, but it's a Toronto institution.</li>
              <li>The best pizza in Toronto is Pizzeria Badiali, 181 Dovercourt Rd. The best value pizza in Toronto is Fresca Pizza and Pasta, 302 College St, $5 for a slice!. A great middle ground is Maker Pizza, 59 Cameron St.</li>
              <li>According to Monica and Edward, the definitive ranking of smashburgers is: 1) Rudy's, 2) Matty's, 3) Harry's, 4) Rosie's.</li>
              <li>The best place for cheap berries (very relevant when you have young children) and fruit more generally is Bloor Fruit Market, 662 Bloor St.</li>
              <li>Grey Gardens, 199 Augusta Ave. For nice dinner out. Somewhat expensive (maybe average $80 per person or so, before alcohol) but doesn't disappoint. Their martini is excellent.</li>
              <li>Bun Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant, 275 Spadina Ave. Great but cheap Vietnamese.</li>
              <li>Nick's Custom Footwear & Shoe Repair, 119 Yonge St. Best place to resole shoes.</li>
              <li>The AGO has a family room in the basement, which is excellent if the weather is bad - enter through the main doors but turn right immediately and continue past coat check then go down. There's a food court a block away - Village by the Grange - which has excellent asian options, especially Manpuku, as well as McDonalds for the children.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Oxford, UK
            <ul>
              <li>Good coffee: New Ground Coffee Oxford, Ship St (some seating, eduroam works); Society Café, 12-16 St Michael's Street (much seating); Missing Bean, 14 Turl St (some seating, limited space but high turnover, eduroam works).</li>
              <li>Good tea and scones: The Independent Cafe, 85-87 St Aldate's, (much seating); Vaults and Garden, 1 Radcliffe Sq (try to go in the morning on a weekday to avoid huge crowd).</li>
              <li>You can get inexpensive access to the Bodleian Libraries with a <a href="https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/join-the-libraries/apply">'Reader' application</a>.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
