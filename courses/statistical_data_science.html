      <h2>Topics in Statistical Data Science</h2>

        <p>Last updated: 2025-07-29</p>

        <p><i><b>THIS IS JUST RANDOM INITIAL THOUGHTS AND NOTHING IS FINALIZED YET.</b></i></p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This course will cover current topics in Data Science from a statistical perspective. The exact topics will vary from year to year. Emphasis will be on practical aspects of data science. This could include tools, workflows, reproducibility and communication through a statistical lens but not all topics will be covered exhaustively every year.</p>
          <p>The exact content will vary year to year but will include practical aspects of data science such as such as tools, workflows, reproducibility and communication. Topics will be taught through a statistical lens and the emphasis and content will vary from year to year. By the end of the course students will (i) have a better understanding of current tools and practices in data science, (ii) will have learned to effectively communicate their findings to a non-statistical audience and (iii) be able to critically evaluate the use of techniques they learned from a statistical viewpoint.</p>

        <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
          <p>The purpose of the course is to develop the skills needed to effectively do data science using modern tools, with a strong statistical focus. By the end of the course, you should be able to:</p>

      <h3>Assessment</h3>

        <p>Using AI is encouraged in the course, but you still need to know the underlying material, in the same way that you still need to know how to add even though everyone has calculators. As such, assessment is divided into "secure" and "insecure" based on whether you will have access to AI to help you. The maximum that you can receive overall is the proportion that you get on secure assessment. For instance, if you got 100% on secure assessment, then your grade would be worked out based on the weights below. But if you only got 50% on secure assessment, then even if you got 100% on everything else your overall grade would be 50%.</p>

        <h4>In-class presentation</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Due dates: As a small group, you will present about the topic of the week.</li>
            <li>Type: Secure</li>
            <li>Weight: 20 per cent.</li>
            <li>Task: As part of a small team, you should prepare slides and a worksheet using Quarto. Use the slides to deliver a 1 hour lecture about the topic of the week. There must be some aspect of live-coding in the lecture. After the lecture, you should have the class actively go through your worksheet for 30 min. Finally you should answer questions and lead discussion for 30 min. You should use GitHub PRs to put together the slides, working within the class repo. You will be graded on: your use of GitHub to work as a team to create content, your content and its delivery, and your ability to answer questions. All team members will receive the same grade. Groups and topics will be created in Week 1.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Weekly online quiz</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Due dates: Weekly, weeks 1-3, 5-8, 10-12.</li>
            <li>Type: Insecure</li>
            <li>Weight: 5 per cent, total.</li>
            <li>Task: Complete an online quiz.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Mid-terms</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Due dates: In-class Week 4 and Week 9.</li>
            <li>Type: Secure</li>
            <li>Weight: 20 per cent each.</li>
            <li>Task: Write a test in exam conditions. Questions are based on content from the part.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Final paper</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Due date: Exam block.</li>
            <li>Type: Insecure</li>
            <li>Weight: 35 per cent.</li>
            <li>Task: Write an original paper on a topic covered in the class, submit it to a journal, and get through desk-rejection. One idea would be to develop a benchmark in a particular area of interest and then evaluate an LLM's performance. You should discuss what you'd like to explore with me early in the semester, and you should have written permission from me by Reading Week.</li>
