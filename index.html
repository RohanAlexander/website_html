          I am an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, jointly appointed in the <a href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca/profile/rohan-alexander/">Faculty of Information</a> and the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/rohan-alexander">Department of Statistical Sciences</a>. I am interested in developing workflows that improve the trustworthiness of data science and tend to be especially focused on the role of code and testing.

        <p>
          With <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/">Kelly Lyons</a> I run <a href="tdw.html">Toronto Data Workshop</a>, a weekly, free, online, seminar series that brings together academia and industry to share data science and AI best practice. <a href="https://rohanalexander.substack.com">Sign up</a> for email invitations.

          My book, <a href="https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/"><i>Telling Stories With Data</i></a>, argues that a trustworthiness revolution is needed in data science, and proposes a view of what it could look like. It has been strongly endorsed, including: Andrew Gelman <i>"I absolutely love this book"</i>, Kosuke Imai <i>"I highly recommend this unique book!"</i>, Sir David Spiegelhalter <i>"[A]n extraordinary, wonderful, book..."</i>, Daniela Witten <i>"An excellent book"</i>, and Richard McElreath <i>"This is not another statistics book. It is much better than that."</i> You can <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Telling-Stories-with-Data-With-Applications-in-R/Alexander/p/book/9781032134772">buy a print copy</a> or <a href="https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/">access the free online version</a>.
